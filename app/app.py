Sure! Here's an example of Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint for accessing the F&F approval request form
@app.route('/approval-request', methods=['GET'])
def get_approval_request_form():
    # Return the form HTML or render a template for the form
    return "F&F Approval Request Form"

# Endpoint for submitting the F&F approval request
@app.route('/approval-request', methods=['POST'])
def submit_approval_request():
    # Get the case remarks and other relevant details from the request
    case_remarks = request.form.get('case_remarks')
    # Process and validate the request data

    # Send the F&F approval request to QC2 / Regional Manager
    # Update the case status to 'F&F Approval Pending with QC2'

    # Send an auto-mailer with the basic case details to QC2 / Regional Manager

    # Return a success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'F&F approval request submitted successfully'})

# Endpoint for QC2 / Regional Manager to review and provide recommendation
@app.route('/approval-request/<request_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def review_approval_request(request_id):
    # Get the decision and remarks from the request
    decision = request.form.get('decision')
    remarks = request.form.get('remarks')
    # Process and validate the request data

    # Capture the decision and remarks in the system
    # Update the case status based on the decision

    # Return a success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Approval request reviewed successfully'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines three endpoints:
1. `/approval-request` (GET): This endpoint allows the LSO to access the F&F approval request form.
2. `/approval-request` (POST): This endpoint allows the LSO to submit the F&F approval request with case remarks.
3. `/approval-request/<request_id>` (PUT): This endpoint allows the QC2 / Regional Manager to review the request and provide their recommendation.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements and database setup.
